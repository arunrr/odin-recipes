    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These sliders really taste like pizza (as they should) but with a hint of
      sweetness from the Hawaiian rolls. Trying to separate them can get messy
      but they are absolutely delicious.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>

      <li>
        1 <sub>1/2</sub> cups (6 oz.) finely pre-shredded low-moisture part-skim
        mozzarella cheese
      </li>

      <li>1 cup (about 3 1/2 oz.) finely pre-shredded Italian cheese blend</li>

      <li><sub>1/4</sub> cup finely chopped fresh basil</li>

      <li><sub>1/4</sub> teaspoon black pepper</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning, divided</li>

      <li>1 <sub>1/3</sub> cups pizza sauce (from 1 [13-oz.] jar)</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato pesto</li>

      <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian sweet rolls</li>

      <li><sub>3/4</sub> cup (about 3 oz.) thinly sliced pepperoni</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
        sheet with parchment, and place a cooling rack on baking sheet. Spray
        rack with cooking spray.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir together mozzarella, Italian cheese blend, basil, pepper, and 1 1/2
        teaspoons of the Italian seasoning in a small bowl until combined. Set
        aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir together pizza sauce and pesto in another small bowl. Set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Without separating the individual rolls, cut the entire slab of rolls in
        half horizontally using a serrated knife. Place bottom layer of rolls on
        the prepared baking sheet. Set top layer of rolls aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sprinkle bottom layer of rolls evenly with half of the cheese mixture;
        top evenly with half of pepperoni and half of the sauce. Repeat layers
        once.
      </li>

      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 15 minutes.</li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine butter, Parmesan, garlic powder, and remaining 1/2
        teaspoon Italian seasoning in a small saucepan; cook over medium,
        stirring occasionally, until butter melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove rolls from oven, and add top layer of rolls; brush top of rolls
        evenly with butter mixture. Return to preheated oven, and bake until
        rolls are golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Separate the rolls,
        and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
