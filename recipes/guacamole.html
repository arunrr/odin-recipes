        <p class="container">
          Decades back when living in Bangalore and Goa, I used to see avocados
          in the markets but did not know what to do with them. So they would
          never make it to my vegetable groceries until I was introduced again
          to this amazing fruit when a friend made the simplest guacamole. We
          liked his version of guacamole recipe. From then on I have been
          experimenting with guacamole and finally, come to this version which
          we love at home. Much richer and better in taste than my friend's
          version who introduced us to guacamole. My guacamole recipe which I
          have been making for decades now is very easy and has fresh
          ingredients.

        <ol class="container">
          <li>
            First, finely chop 1 small onion, 1 small tomato, mince or finely
            chop 1 small clove of garlic, 1 to 2 serrano peppers or jalape√±o
            peppers or green chillies and cilantro (coriander leaves). You will
            <span class="small-text">1/4</span> cup finely chopped tomatoes and
            need <span class="small-text">1/4</span> cup finely chopped onion,
            tablespoons chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). Garlic is optional
            and can be skipped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take all these chopped ingredients in a mixing bowl. Keep aside.
            chopped onions, tomatoes, peppers, coriander leaves, garlic in a
            mixing bowl
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a ripe avocado and cut it from the center horizontally or
            vertically into two equal halves.
          </li>
          <li>
            So now you have the two avocado halves. Remove the seed with a
            spoon. Now you can scoop the avocado pulp with a spoon.
          </li>
          <li>
            I scoop the avocado pulp and then place these on the chopping board.
            You can even place the scooped avocado pulp directly in the mixing
            bowl.
          </li>
          <li>Then chop them.</li>
          <li>Place the chopped avocado in the mixing bowl.</li>
          <li>Add 2 teaspoons lemon juice or add as required.</li>
          <li>Drizzle 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil.</li>
          <li>
            Lastly, season with salt as per taste and 1/4 teaspoon crushed black
            pepper or ground black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix very well. Mash the avocado whilst mixing. Check the taste and
            add more salt, black pepper or lemon juice if required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve this best guacamole with toast, tortilla chips, nachos or as
            an accompaniment with a Burrito or quesadilla. You can garnish with
            a few coriander leaves while serving.
